My beliefs
==========

On Morality
-----------
* Gay marriage should be legal everywhere
* Marijuana should be legal
* Being good is in our nature (being evil requires misinformation or partial information)
* Abortion should be legal
* Assisted suicide should be legal
* Health care should be available to everyone who needs it
* The death penalty should be used in extreme and certain cases to protect the public
* Prisons should be about protecting the public, not about punishing the criminal
* The world's average morality is improving as it becomes more connected

On Spirituality
---------------
* Souls don't exist
* The Gods of organized religion don't exist
* Intention can't create reality (it just changes our perception of it)
* Astrology is entertainment
* Magic and miracles don't exist
* There is no afterlife
* We don't have a purpose given to us, but we can make one up

On Science
----------
* Other dimensions and universes exist
* Micro and macro evolution happens
* Something like the Big Bang happened
* Something existed before the Big Bang (outside of time and space as we know them)
* Nothing in our universe will travel faster than light
* The human brain (in its current state of evolution) can't comprehend the universe

On Health
---------
* We can change our behavior and habits (it's not as easy as it seems)
* Consistently eating well and exercising is the only way to be sustainably healthy
* Acupuncture works, but I have no idea how
* Vaccinations are good for babies and society

On Technology
-------------
* Computers will be building better computers than humans by 2050 (the Singularity)
* Humans, computers, and Earth will evolve into a super organism by 2200
* Humans that embrace change (and give up some of their humanity) will survive the Singularity
* Technology will eventually disrupt all other human-created institutions (politics, religion, identity)

On The Self
-----------
* Free will is mostly an illusion (but does exist in limited form)
* Pure altruism is an illusion (but kindness is not)
* We tell stories in order to deduce and remember meaning
* Consciousness is the result of a feedback loop between our story-making cortex and our subconscious (ain't it nice though?)
* Giving up our privacy and individuality in exchange for better connection will be the norm by 2050

On Logic
--------
* Most questions have no answer (asking them anyway is sometimes entertaining, but nothing else)
* Logic is a helpful tool, but has flaws and can't be relied on entirely

On Aliens & Space Travel
------------------------
* Aliens exist
* Non-carbon-based life forms exist
* Space travel throughout the universe is probably entirely the domain of robots and cyborgs
* I haven't entirely ruled out a Matrix-like origin story for the universe

On Education
------------
* Something will replace universities as we currently know them by 2030

On Politics & The Economy
-------------------------
* Most jobs lost in 2008-present aren't going to come back, they have to be created from scratch
* We'll have a President that admits to being atheist or agnostic by 2025
* Power should be redistributed when it gets too heavy at the top

On Biases
---------
* We tend to favor the beautiful
* We tend to see what we expect to see
* We tend to attribute too much credit to success (and under-credit luck)

On Love
-------
* Soulmates exist
* Love at first sight happens

Meta
----
* We have very little control over what we believe in
* Some of my beliefs will be proven wrong
* I'm willing to be convinced that my beliefs are wrong
* Making and maintaining this list is useful and fun (you should do it too)
