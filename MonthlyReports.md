# Monthly Reports
Updates on changes to my weight, daily primes, and goals. Review on the 1st of every month ([README](README.md)) and share each month's update with close friends.

### 2014: 

##### May 1st 2014: 
*Weight:* 174.7 (+1.4) 

*Outcome of previous goal:* Miss. I did 129 slow pushups in April (12 out of 30 days: 40%). My 4 month streak of doing fewer pushups each month continues... but this month I did switch it up to do even slower pushups than the month before. Instead of resting at the bottom and top of each pushup, I'm trying to keep a constant slow speed at all times. I learned this in slow weights a few years ago and it makes them much harder while also making it harder to "cheat" by hopping up and down too fast.

*New goal:* Do more than 129 slow pushups (only count first set) on 13 or more days. 

##### Apr 1st 2014: 
*Weight:* 173.3 (-0.8) 

*Outcome of previous goal:* Miss. I did 148 slow pushups in March (13 out of 31 days: 42%), but I went from a best of 15 to a best of 18, for a 20% improvement. Totally fell off the wagon (and so far in the first few days of April still off the wagon). Also got sick and didn't get down to 167.1 lbs -- still hovering above 170. Sort of a loser of a month for me all around. Oops!

*New goal:* Do more than 148 slow pushups (only count first set) on 14 or more days. 


##### Mar 1st 2014: 
*Weight:* 174.1 (+1.6) 

*Outcome of previous goal:* Miss. I did 183 slow pushups in Feb (19 out of 28 days: 68%), but I went from a best of 12 to a best of 15, for a 25% improvement. They're definitely starting to feel easier, and I feel like my form is improving. 

*New goal:* Do more than 183 slow pushups (only count first set) on 20 or more days. Also, lose 4% of my weight and get to 167.1 lbs.

##### Feb 1st 2014: 
*Weight:* 172.7 (-0.5)

*Outcome of previous goal:* Hit. I'm only counting the first set of the day, as I found I'm more likely to find the time if I only focus on 1 set. Did 192 last month on 20 out of 28 days. I'm also using pushup bars and doing them in as close to perfect form as I can, very slowly. Finding that 10 slow, good posture pushups is pretty tough. On days when I'm not feeling it, I am fine with doing only a couple -- doing them every day (eventually) is more important than doing a whole bunch on a single day. I want to make this a life-long goal, something I do every day even when I'm 80 years old.

*New goal:* Do more than 192 pushups (only count first set) on 20 or more days.

*Quality moments from previous month:*

##### Jan 1st 2014:
*Weight:* 173.2 (+1.6)

*Outcome of previous goal:* Hit

*New goal:* Do pushups at least 4 days a week, find a baseline for pushups in a month that I can try to beat next month. I need to do at least the minimal amount of exercise other than bike riding because I feel like my energy levels are really low. Admittedly, none of my interests have anything to do with pushups... I just choose them because they're the easiest. But there's no internal motivation beyond easiness pushing me forward. Is it possible to enjoy pushups for themselves? If this doesn't work I may need to rely on biking more as my outlet for exercise.

*Quality moments from previous month:* 
* 1st: Went to Scribe with Katie, met up with Mira and Tom
* 6th: Katie stayed with us, we played Cards Against Humanity
* 7th: Picked out a Christmas tree with Bojee and Alycah
* 8th: Hilarious dinner at Paisan with Katie and Jimmy James
* 15th: Went to Tilden Park Carousel with Brasa, Bojee, and friends

* 17th: Inspiring product manager Christmas party, going away party for Mark (our intern)
* 19th: Twitter holiday party: biggest fanciest party we've ever been to (at City Hall)
* 20th: Closed on sale of my Belltown loft! Paid off all credit cards and the car as well. Stoked.
* 21st: Christmas Tree Lane in Alameda
* 24th: Christmas Eve at Kristy's house with Mom, Ryan and Adelyn (Ryan's reading of The Night Before Christmas went over especially well)
* 25th: Adelyn saying "I'm feeling really good right now!" after opening gifts

##### Confused about apps
I got confused about tracking meditation and quality time in my apps. I tried Lift, and another one called The Way of Life (that turned out to be not so great).
