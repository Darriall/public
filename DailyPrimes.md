# Daily Primes
Things I'd like to have primed in my brain every morning. Review on the 1st of every month ([README](README.md)).

### Look at what's uncomfortable
This is where all the unresolved, unwanted, conflicted things are that need attention. 

### Slog towards riding a bike on my 100th birthday
Eat mostly plants. Exercise regularly. Think decades, not days.

### Remember, I will die
He who dies with the most death bed points, wins. (via [The Death Bed Game](https://medium.com/better-humans/20cc8d9c7494))
