# Daily Primes
Things I'd like to have primed in my brain every morning. Review on the 1st of every month ([README](README.md)).

### Look at my fish
Inspired by a dozen reads of [fish, a tap essay](https://readtapestry.com/s/YuyuuzQO8/).

### Love my family
They are my people.

### Plan to be healthy at 100
Eat mostly plants. Exercise so I can still ride a bike at 100. Think decades, not days.

### Remember, I will die
He who dies with the most death bed points, wins. (via [The Death Bed Game](https://medium.com/better-humans/20cc8d9c7494))
