# My Goals

### 2013 Progress: -++++--

##### Aug 2013 : INPROGRESS
I want to track at least 5 "quality times" a week. Quality times that count: quality time with Kellianne, Niko, myself, and work. I'm using a new app to track this, that my friend April passed along to me, it's called The Way of Life (iPhone). It's worth checking out.

I want to do at least 1 thing a day (no days off) that A) gets me closer to being a marathoner B) I do on purpose for this resolution (no retroactive counting), and C) isn't "normal" for me to do. Meditation, running, other exercise, etc all count. I'm tracking my slogs on peabrain.co which has been working for me for a while now.

# Chaos Monkey Tricks

##### Got sick
Coughing up gross stuff, bad sleep, dry throat, headaches. Drank lots of water, took lots of naps, tried to lay low for the most part.

##### App confusion
I got confused about tracking meditation and quality time in my apps. I tried Lift, and another one called The Way of Life (that turned out to be not so great).
