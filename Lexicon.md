# Lexicon
This is an attempt to concisely collect the concepts that have the greatest impact on how I view the world in one place. Review on the 1st of every month ([README](README.md)). 

## Codex Vitae
* This document's purpose was inspired by Robin Sloan's book, *Mr Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore*. I wrote up some notes on [Way of the Duck](http://wayoftheduck.com/codex-vitae).
* Quote from the book: "And this is the other treasure. Following in the Founder’s footsteps, every member of this fellowship produces his or her own codex vitae, or book of life. It is the task of the unbound. Fedorov, for example, who you know"—he nods to me—"is one of these. When he is finished, he will have poured everything he has learned, all his knowledge, into a book like these."
* Related to the [Beliefs File](Beliefs.md) and the great essay from Elle Luna, [The Crossroads of Should and Must](https://medium.com/medium-long/90c75eb7c5b0).

## Umwelt
* Here's the [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umwelt) on this really fascinating idea.
* The [XKCD comic about it](http://xkcd.com/1037/), and an [explanation](http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1037:_Umwelt).
* My original write-up about it on [Way of the Duck](http://wayoftheduck.com/know-thy-umwelt).
* Related to this idea: mental models, systems thinking (from [The Fifth Discipline](http://www.amazon.com/The-Fifth-Discipline-Practice-Organization/dp/0553456342))
* Related to this great post, [UX and the Civilizing Process](http://kevinsimler.quora.com/UX-and-the-Civilizing-Process) by Kevin Simler, specifically the quote, "The concept of a person is arguably the most important interface ever developed."

## Quality Time
* I'm circling around the idea in several posts: [How I track my life](https://medium.com/buster-benson/7da6f22b8e2c), [Live like a hydra](https://medium.com/better-humans/c02337782a89), [Make better resolutions](https://medium.com/buster-benson/69cda443d387), [Experimenting with subjectivity](http://wayoftheduck.com/subjectivity), [If you lived 100 times](https://readtapestry.com/s/RVwPvalHq/).
* 3 kinds: quality time with your self, with your people, and with your interests

## Antifragility
* Basically a combination of several great ideas: optionality, feedback loops, and natural selection.
* Explored in great clarity and depth in [Antifragile](http://www.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Gain-Disorder/dp/1400067820/).
* I wrote about several of the ideas in [Live like a hydra](https://medium.com/better-humans/c02337782a89).

## Kiloslog
* My original thoughts posted on [Way of the Duck](https://medium.com/better-humans/52167e196771).
* It's the flip side of the Quality Time coin. Before you can be in the flow, you need to dig the trenches... that's the slog. 
* Related to belief-change, identity-change, and circumstance-change.
