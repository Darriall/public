# Personal canon
Material that I have come back to a lot and which has influenced some of the thinking in the TIL. Categorized by source type.

> **Flow is the feed.** It’s the posts and the tweets. It’s the stream of daily and sub-daily updates that remind people that you exist.
> 
> **Stock is the durable stuff.** It’s the content you produce that’s as interesting in two months (or two years) as it is today. It’s what people discover via search. It’s what spreads slowly but surely, building fans over time.
