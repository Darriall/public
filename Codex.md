# Codex Vitae

## How to play

1. **Every day:** In the morning, scroll down to Review Every Day

3. **Every year:** On your birthday, scroll down to Review Every Year

## Review Every Day
Things I'd like to have primed in my brain every morning.

1. **Look at what's uncomfortable:** Don't avoid the unresolved, unwanted, conflicted things that would benefit from attention.

## Lexicon
This is an list of ideas that have gotten hopelessly stuck in my brain. 

### Codex Vitae

The idea is simple: write a book that, to the best of its ability, contains the most concise yet accurate essence of the things that I learned about myself and the universe during my life. When the essence of a thing can't be captured, resort to sign posts, bread crumbs, whatever is the closest hint or clue about the thing that I *could* capture. I have pretty much lifted this idea wholesale from Robin Sloan's book, *Mr Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore*. A quote from the book: "And this is the other treasure. Following in the Founder’s footsteps, every member of this fellowship produces his or her own codex vitae, or book of life. It is the task of the unbound. Fedorov, for example, who you know"—he nods to me—"is one of these. When he is finished, he will have poured everything he has learned, all his knowledge, into a book like these." I wrote up some notes on [Way of the Duck](http://wayoftheduck.com/codex-vitae) shortly after reading the book, and I haven't really been able to stop thinking about it since. Hence this entire codex itself.

In order to write a codex vitae, I'd have to first learn things about myself and the universe. In this way, a prerequisite for even getting started is that I spend some quality time in my own head and eventually "[find my must](https://medium.com/medium-long/90c75eb7c5b0)" as Elle Luna would say.

If the Singularity ever happens and the technology to download our brains ever comes about, you could say that the riddle of the codex vitae will have been solved. Until then, silly projects like <a href="http://wayoftheduck.com/diy-horse-ebooks">@buster_ebooks</a> will sprout up, and I'll keep working on this somewhat more primitive attempt.

### Quality Time

**Notes:**
* I'm circling around the idea in several posts: [How I track my life](https://medium.com/buster-benson/7da6f22b8e2c), [Live like a hydra](https://medium.com/better-humans/c02337782a89), [Make better resolutions](https://medium.com/buster-benson/69cda443d387), [Experimenting with subjectivity](http://wayoftheduck.com/subjectivity), [If you lived 100 times](https://readtapestry.com/s/RVwPvalHq/).
* 3 kinds: quality time with your self, with your people, and with your interests

### Kiloslog

**Notes:**
* My original thoughts posted on [Way of the Duck](https://medium.com/better-humans/52167e196771).
* It's the flip side of the Quality Time coin. Before you can be in the flow, you need to dig the trenches... that's the slog. 
* Related to belief-change, identity-change, and circumstance-change.

### Antifragility

**Notes:**
* Basically a combination of several great ideas: optionality, feedback loops, and natural selection.
* Explored in great clarity and depth in [Antifragile](http://www.amazon.com/Antifragile-Things-That-Gain-Disorder/dp/1400067820/).
* I wrote about several of the ideas in [Live like a hydra](https://medium.com/better-humans/c02337782a89).

### Umwelt

They say that the brain is the only thing to ever name itself. Emily Dickenson also says, "The Brain — is wider than the Sky — For — put them side by side — The one the other will contain With ease — and You — beside." The simplest way for me to describe what "umwelt" means to me: it is the representation of the universe in our brain. The mental model of not only the universe, but the self, and of even the concept of an umwelt itself. As humans, we are fully contained in our umwelt, and we can't think outside the umwelt.

It's a super fascinating idea once you dive into it a bit. A couple links: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umwelt), the [XKCD comic about it](http://xkcd.com/1037/) (with [explanation](http://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/1037:_Umwelt)), my [original blog post](http://wayoftheduck.com/know-thy-umwelt) about it, and this great post, [UX and the Civilizing Process](http://kevinsimler.quora.com/UX-and-the-Civilizing-Process) by Kevin Simler, specifically the quote, "The concept of a person is arguably the most important interface ever developed."

Mental models are explored in pretty good depth in a couple books I've read: [The Fifth Discipline](http://www.amazon.com/The-Fifth-Discipline-Practice-Organization/dp/0553456342), [Creativity, Inc](http://www.amazon.com/Creativity-Inc-Overcoming-Unseen-Inspiration/dp/0804127441), and [Thinking Fast and Slow](http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555).

Emily Dickenson is actually a bit misleading in her poem. The actual universe is made up of not only the sea, but also all of our ideas of the sea, our mental models of the sea, and our mental models of the universe. But the quirks involved in how we *seem* to fit the universe in our heads is the trail head for a ton of super interesting ideas: mental models, systems thinking, concept of the self, the manufactured normalcy field, priming, and pattern matching.

2. Pure altruism is an illusion (but kindness is not)

### On Education
1. Something will replace universities as we currently know them by 2030

### On Politics & The Economy

# Monthly Reports

### 2014: ++---

##### May 1st 2014: 
*Weight:* 174.7 (+1.4) 

*Outcome of previous goal:* Miss. I did 129 slow pushups in April (12 out of 30 days: 40%). My 4 month streak of doing fewer pushups each month continues... but this month I did switch it up to do even slower pushups than the month before. Instead of resting at the bottom and top of each pushup, I'm trying to keep a constant slow speed at all times. I learned this in slow weights a few years ago and it makes them much harder while also making it harder to "cheat" by hopping up and down too fast.

*New goal:* Do more than 129 slow pushups (only count first set) on 13 or more days. 

##### Apr 1st 2014: 
*Weight:* 173.3 (-0.8) 

*Outcome of previous goal:* Miss. I did 148 slow pushups in March (13 out of 31 days: 42%), but I went from a best of 15 to a best of 18, for a 20% improvement. Totally fell off the wagon (and so far in the first few days of April still off the wagon). Also got sick and didn't get down to 167.1 lbs -- still hovering above 170. Sort of a loser of a month for me all around. Oops!

*New goal:* Do more than 148 slow pushups (only count first set) on 14 or more days. 

##### Mar 1st 2014: 
*Weight:* 174.1 (+1.6) 

*Outcome of previous goal:* Miss. I did 183 slow pushups in Feb (19 out of 28 days: 68%), but I went from a best of 12 to a best of 15, for a 25% improvement. They're definitely starting to feel easier, and I feel like my form is improving. 

*New goal:* Do more than 183 slow pushups (only count first set) on 20 or more days. Also, lose 4% of my weight and get to 167.1 lbs.

##### Feb 1st 2014: 
*Weight:* 172.7 (-0.5)

*Outcome of previous goal:* Hit. I'm only counting the first set of the day, as I found I'm more likely to find the time if I only focus on 1 set. Did 192 last month on 20 out of 28 days. I'm also using pushup bars and doing them in as close to perfect form as I can, very slowly. Finding that 10 slow, good posture pushups is pretty tough. On days when I'm not feeling it, I am fine with doing only a couple -- doing them every day (eventually) is more important than doing a whole bunch on a single day. I want to make this a life-long goal, something I do every day even when I'm 80 years old.

*New goal:* Do more than 192 pushups (only count first set) on 20 or more days.

*Quality moments from previous month:*
* 3rd-5th: Nursing Kellianne with her healing foot post-surgery. Fun for Niko and I to take care of her and watch her watch all of Doctor Who.
* 10th: Hack week at work, won. 
* 12th: Went to Children's Fairyland with Niko, Brasa, Bode, Alykah, Zuri, Spike, Indy, Juniper.
* 18th: Dinner at Anneke and Casey's (first time at their place)
* 20th: Long bike ride with Niko where he biked up the pedestrian bridge (both ways) without stopping!
* 23rd: My work project launched: analytics.twitter.com (super smooth launch, team is in high spirits)
* 23rd: First date night in a long time: Wood Tavern. Funny conversations with the bartender and other guests.
* 25th: Quality neighbor dinner time with Bode and Brasa while kids watched movies
* 26th: Went to the steam trains with Niko, went on the trains 3 times!
* 29th: Quality friend times with Tony Stubblebine and Sarah. They brought dinner to us.
* 30th: ModelViewCulture launch party, got to celebrate Amelia's new thing

##### Jan 1st 2014:
*Weight:* 173.2 (+1.6)

*Outcome of previous goal:* Hit

*New goal:* Do pushups at least 4 days a week, find a baseline for pushups in a month that I can try to beat next month. I need to do at least the minimal amount of exercise other than bike riding because I feel like my energy levels are really low. Admittedly, none of my interests have anything to do with pushups... I just choose them because they're the easiest. But there's no internal motivation beyond easiness pushing me forward. Is it possible to enjoy pushups for themselves? If this doesn't work I may need to rely on biking more as my outlet for exercise.

*Quality moments from previous month:* 
* 1st: Went to Scribe with Katie, met up with Mira and Tom
* 6th: Katie stayed with us, we played Cards Against Humanity
* 7th: Picked out a Christmas tree with Bojee and Alycah
* 8th: Hilarious dinner at Paisan with Katie and Jimmy James
* 15th: Went to Tilden Park Carousel with Brasa, Bojee, and friends
* 16th: Made a Thomas train out of construction paper with Niko. Big hit.
* 17th: Inspiring product manager Christmas party, going away party for Mark (our intern)
* 19th: Twitter holiday party: biggest fanciest party we've ever been to (at City Hall)
* 20th: Closed on sale of my Belltown loft! Paid off all credit cards and the car as well. Stoked.
* 21st: Christmas Tree Lane in Alameda
* 24th: Christmas Eve at Kristy's house with Mom, Ryan and Adelyn (Ryan's reading of The Night Before Christmas went over especially well)
* 25th: Adelyn saying "I'm feeling really good right now!" after opening gifts
* 26th: Delicious dinner at Sushi Kimo
* 27th: Great bike ride to Corona del Mar with Kellianne

*Self-declared badges:*
* Sold The House Badge
* Debt Free Badge

### 2013: -++++---+--++ 

##### Dec 1st 2013:

* 7th: Twitter IPO, celebrated with coworkers and Kellianne at Ryan Sarver’s get together at Tradition. I feel grateful for a chance to participate in Twitter’s history.
* 8th: Dinner with Brasa, Bojee, and Alycka at their house. I can tell we’re going to become friends.
* 10th: Took the training wheels off Niko’s bike, and discovered that he was able to ride it after only about 15 minutes of practice!
* 16-17th: Kellianne’s in Seattle so Niko and I had the weekend to ourselves. A first? Took the opportunity to super-bond with the little guy. Fave moments include biking to the Farmer’s Market, having him read The Giving Tree to me, letting him be boss and come up with rules, tossing kettle corn into each others’ mouths while relaxing on the hammock, the Muppets dance party in our living room, and the long uphill bike ride up to College Ave for an ice cream.
* 21st: Highly enjoyable conversation with Tony Stubblebine at Smuggler’s Cove.
* 23rd: A fun birthday party for Niko’s friend Alykah, wherein we solidify our friendship with the neighbors down the street.

* 30th: Katie visits and amongst other things a beautiful golden hour bike ride at the park.

##### Nov 2013:
*Weight:* 171.6 (+0.5)

*Outcome of previous goal:* Miss

*New goal:* I want to continue to track my modes through Lift at least 5 days a week. Write a blog post sometime in the month about finding the signal for quality time.

##### Oct 2013:
*Weight:* 171.1 (+0.9)

*Outcome of previous goal:* Miss

*New goal:* I want to continue to track my modes through Lift at least 5 days a week. And also, I want to write a blog post sometime in the month about finding a signal for quality time that isn’t so ambiguous.

##### Sep 2013:
*Weight:* 170.2

*Outcome of previous goal:* Hit

*New goal:* I want to continue to track my modes through Lift at least 5 days a week, and in addition track whether or not I experience quality time that matches the given mode. For example, quality sleep in recovery mode, meditation in self mode, quality time with someone in people mode, etc. 

##### Aug 2013:
*Outcome of previous goal:* Miss

*New goal:* I want to take a step back from static goals and instead have mode-specific goals. First step, track my modes for a month (from Live Like a Hydra) to see how they break down.

##### Jul 2013:
*Outcome of previous goal:* Miss

*New goal:* I want to track at least 5 "quality times" a week. Quality times that count: quality time with Kellianne, Niko, myself, and work. I'm using a new app to track this, that my friend April passed along to me, it's called The Way of Life (iPhone). It's worth checking out.

##### Jun 2013:

*New goal:** Meditate at least 5 minutes 5 days a week.

##### May 2013:
*Outcome of previous goal:* Hit

*New goal:* I want to do at least 1 thing a day (no days off) that A) gets me closer to being a marathoner B) I do on purpose for this resolution (no retroactive counting), and C) isn't "normal" for me to do. Meditation, running, other exercise, etc all count. I'm tracking my slogs on peabrain.co which has been working for me for a while now.

##### Apr 2013:
